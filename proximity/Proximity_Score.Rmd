# Goal

Compute proximities between disease and drug gene lists, using the the interactome graph object. 

# Setup

## Libraries
```{r}
# library(data.table)
library(igraph)
# our own custom functions
source("functions.R")
```

## Data
```{r}
# inputs from Generate_Interactome_Network.Rmd
inputs <- readRDS("inputs.rds")
```

# Analysis

For each diease gene list and each drug, compute the proximity score for each pair of genes. This will result in a matrix of disease genes x drug targets where each value is a proximity score.
```{r}

```
